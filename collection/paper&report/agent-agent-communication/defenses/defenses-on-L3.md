# Defenses on L3

**Note**: Due to the forward-looking nature of this paper, the defenses we mentioned include both **the proposed ones** and **potential directions that have not been studied**. As a result, some defenses may lack a concrete list of papers, we hope our paper can inspire these directions.
## D1: Cross-agent Input Detection


## D2: Permission Classification and Control
- [2025/03] **[Prompt Flow Integrity to Prevent Privilege Escalation in LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15547)**
- [2025/03] **[AgentSpec: Customizable Runtime Enforcement for Safe and Reliable LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18666)**
- [2025/05] **[LLM Agents Should Employ Security Principles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24019)**

## D3: Malicious Instruction Filtering

## D4: Multi-source Semantic Cross-Validation


## D5: Defense for Semantic Rewriting Attack


## D6: Defense for Cognitive and Ethical Drift


## D7: Defense for Contextual Fragmentation
